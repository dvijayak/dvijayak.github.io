### Truth is a Person.

In the fighting, I am learning more of Him. Sometimes He is just as I had predicted or expected, and so I parry Him with confidence and success. Other times, He surprises me -- sometimes even totally baffles me -- and I am wounded severely by His slashes and grapples.

But over time my wounds heal, and I obtain a deeper understanding of Him. *The more I wrestle, the closer I get to Him.*

My account sounds harsh. 'Tis, indeed. Such is the nature of Truth. *He has no favourites.* He is apparently cold and dispassionate.

But fortunately for me, the Truth is also Love. Compassion. Kindness. Gentleness. Humility. Grace.

And *that* makes all the difference in my pursuit thereof. He breathes new meaning into my vocation of knowledge and understanding.

Truth is a Person. His name is **Jesus**. To know truth then is to know Jesus. And when I'm wrestling with said truth, I am wrestling with *THE* Truth; with Jesus.
