title: Ambitious Beginnings

This is a series of blog posts that served as an assignment for the course titled **Social Implications of Computing** ([CIS*3000](https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2010-2011/courses/cis3000.shtml)) during [my undergraduate studies](https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2010-2011/c10/c10bcomp.shtml) at the [University of Guelph](https://uoguelph.ca). It was originally published on a [free Wordpress.com site](https://danielvijayakumar.wordpress.com/{{ include.url }}) I had created for the course.

I believe in forever remembering the place from which I emerged, so I have migrated all the content to this site, to remain here for perpetual reference.

I have diligently attempted to preserve verbatim the original text and formatting. Keep in mind however that some links may be broken and that some content might be totally outdated given the month/year that you are reading them.
